# secretsapp
- This project is a hands-on practice with angela yu.
- This project explains all the 6 stages of security 
     1. Authentication.(worked flawlessly) [Via mongoDB login]
     2. Encryption. (worked good enough)[via mongoose-encryption package]
     3. Hashing.(worked very good)[via md5 package]
     4. Salting and Hashing(nope, didn't work)[via bcrypt package]
     5. Cookies and Sessions(worked flawlessly)[via session,passport.js libs.]
     6. Oauth 2.0 (didn't work)[code ran good but the Oauth window was not getting opened in browser]. 

Due to the Yu Angela course being 2018 ish so, its kinda expected that some of the components/packages/libs will get deprecated and there may or may not be a better solution. 
so just grasp the concept and retry in google.
